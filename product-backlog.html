    <h1>Product Backlog</h1>
    <p>The Product Backlog is an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product.
    It is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team.
    [<a href="https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#product-backlog">Scrum Guide</a>]
    Informally, one can think of the Product Backlog as the project's prioritized to-do list,
    a prioritized list of desired features, or the prioritized list of things that need to be
    done in order to reach the goal or Product Vision.</p>
    
    <h2>Who is involved?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>Product Owner</strong> is responsible for the Product Backlog, including its content, visibility and ordering.</li>
      <li>The Product Owner can delegate some of the product backlog management work to others and/or can consult others to provide input but remains accountable.</li>
      <li><strong>Everyone</strong> can put something on the Product Backlog, but the Product Owner has the final say.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>What's in the Product Backlog?</h2>
    <p>The Product Backlog consists of:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>A statement of the Product Goal, the long-term objective of the Scrum Team.
      The Product Goal could be a statement of the Product Vision or it could be one piece of a larger Product Vision.</li>
      <li>An ordered (by priority) list of Product Backlog Items (PBIs) that are needed to improve the product from where it stands today.</li>
    </ol>
