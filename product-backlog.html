    <h1>Product Backlog</h1>
    <p>The Product Backlog is an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product.
    It is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team.
    [<a href="https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#product-backlog">Scrum Guide</a>]
    Informally, one can think of the Product Backlog as the project's prioritized to-do list,
    a prioritized list of desired features, or the prioritized list of things that need to be
    done in order to reach the goal or Product Vision.</p>
    
    <h2>Who is involved?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>Product Owner</strong> is responsible for the Product Backlog, including its content, visibility and ordering.</li>
      <li>The Product Owner can delegate some of the product backlog management work to others and/or can consult others to provide input but remains accountable.</li>
      <li><strong>Everyone</strong> can put something on the Product Backlog, but the Product Owner has the final say.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>What's in the Product Backlog?</h2>
    <p>The Product Backlog consists of:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>A statement of the Product Goal, the long-term objective of the Scrum Team.
      The Product Goal could be a statement of the Product Vision or it could be one piece of a larger Product Vision.</li>
      <li>An ordered (by priority) list of Product Backlog Items (PBIs) that are needed to improve the product from where it stands today.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Product Backlog Items (Beyond Core Scrum)</h2>
    <p>Product Backlog Items (PBIs) often have attributes such as:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Description: a statement of what the goal of the PBI is.</li>
      <li>Order: a rank (1, 2, 3, &ellip;) of the item's priority as determined by the Product Owner, often based on the Value and Estimate (below)</li>
      <li>Value: an expression of the business value, determined by the Product Owner. Value can be expressed as </li>
      <li>Effort estimate: an expression of how much effort will be required to complete the item, determined by the Developers.
        Acknowledging that determining an exact estimate how much effort (work), perhaps in hours, is required to complete the item is challenging,
        <em>relative estimation</em> is often used. For example, an effort estimate can be expressed as a t-shirt size (XS, S, M, L, XL, 2XL) or
        as <em>story points</em> where the point values are chosen from a modified fibbonaci sequence (0, 1/2, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100).</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Types of Product Backlog Items (Beyond Core Scrum)</h2>
    <p>While core Scrum does not specify any types or categories of Product Backlog Items, there are some types of Product Backlog Items that
      tend to appear in the Product Backlog, depending on how the Product Owner decides to manage it, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>User Stories (sometimes referred to as features)</li>
      <li>Knowledge Acquisition Stories (sometimes called spikes, learning spikes, prototypes, or proof of concepts)</li>
      <li>Non-functional requirements (sometimes called system-level constraints or system attributes, 
        such as system attributes such as security, reliability, performance, maintainability, scalability, and usability</li>
      <li>Bugs (issues found in the product that are unrelated to the work being done in the current Sprint)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>User Stories</h2>
    
    
    <h2>Tools to Manage the Product Backlog</h2>
    <p>The Agile Manifesto calls for "individuals and interactions over processes and tools", reminding us that we should not let
      any tool drive how our Product Backlog is managed, but rather, it is the Product Owner's role to choose the appropriate tool.
      The Product Owner is responsible for ensuring the Product Backlog is visible to others.</p>
    
    <p>Some examples of tools that can be used to manage the Product Backlog include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Excel (<a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/a-sample-format-for-a-spreadsheet-based-product-backlog/comments">
        blog entry by Mike Cohn)</a></li>
      <li>Trello</li>
      <li>Posting on a physical "team wall" where it is visible to the team</li>
    </ul>
